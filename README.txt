This is the second udacity project for Machine Learning Nanodegree Program - Student Intervention System

There are six files in the repository:
(1) student_intervention.ipynb
	This is the ipython code for the project that creates three calssification models namely Decision Tree Classifier, SVM and KNN
(2) student_intervention.py
	This is the python version of the project, it has Adaboost and Random Forest in addition to the classifiers used in ipython
	This file also creates the bar charts of the classification performance of all classifiers that listed below
(3) student_intevention.pdf
	This is report of the project providing answers to required questions and summarizing final outcome 	
(4,5,6) results_finetunemodel_XX_pca_XX.pdf
	These show the histogram and performance of the three configurations
	XX represents whether a configuration is on or off. For instance, pca_True indicates that PCA decomposition is turned on for that model
